    <h1>My Favorite City is in China</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Dalian, China</p>
    <p>I lived in China for 2 years - 2019 - 2020 for my job. Dalian is a small Chinese city . . .
        only about 6.5 million people!</p>
    <p>Dalian is on the west side of the Korea Bay in the Yellow Sea. It has amazing seafood! Here
        are 3 pictures from Dalian and China.</p>
    <p>This is downtown Dalian. </p>
